# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
This is the repo create for the Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project by **Monfalcone Irene** on [https://github.com/irek978/Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project](https://github.com/irek978/Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project)

## The Project
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. **The goal** is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

##The Data Source
The data source represents data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

###The output dataset
The project is based to creating one R script called **run_analysis.R** that does differents steps to manipulating and working the data source. The output dataset is the creation of a second, indipendent tidy dataset, with average of each variable for each activity and each subject (for details see the [CodeBook.md](https://github.com/irek978/Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project/blob/master/CodeBook.md).
